# Social Network Framework

## What is SNF
Social Network Framework (SNF for short) is a pet project. Aims to be a framework to build social networks. Just a blank platform so that
any developer can use as a boilerplate.

## Arquitecture
While this isn't a close deal yet, What is decided for now is

* codeigniter 3+
* composer
* phpunit
* react.js
* jQuery
* MongoDB

## Want to help?
This is my pet project but anyone can hop in and help out. Currently I am looking for another PHP/Javascript developer and a Designer. But
pretty much anyone can help. 

Also donations would be great. Hosting, a domain, etc. Anything would help actually.
